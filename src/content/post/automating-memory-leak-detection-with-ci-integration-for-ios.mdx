This article will not mention how to use the Memory Graph Debugger to identify and fix leaks. I know we already had enough articles for that.

Before going to the main part, let's take a look at this piece of code and answer this question: ‚ÄúDo we have any leak here?‚Äù

```swift

final class Person {
    var apartment: Apartment?
}

final class Apartment {
    var person: Person?
}

// This is the root view controller of the application
final class RootViewController: UIViewController {

    private let apartment = Apartment()
    private let person = Person()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        apartment.person = person
        person.apartment = apartment
    }

}

```

The answer is NO. You can verify with Memory Graph Debugger

You may ask: ‚ÄúWait, what? We have a retain cycle right here, how it can‚Äôt be a leak?‚Äù

***Not all retain cycles are leaks.***

> A leak is a piece of memory for which there are no references to the allocation from any live object in the application‚Äôs live object graph.
> 
> I.e. the memory is unreachable and, thus, there is no way that it can ever be referred to again (barring bugs). It is a dead memory.

To summarize, if we can still access the object, it‚Äôs not a leak. In the piece of code above, we can still access to *apartment* & *object* from the view controller, so it‚Äôs not a leak.

Here is an example of a leak. After the *viewDidLoad*, we can‚Äôt ever access to *apartment* & *person*, but these objects will not be deallocated due to the retain cycle.

<img src={image2.src} alt="Photo by Alexandre Debi√®ve on Unsplash" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />

Now you may think: ‚ÄúIn the first example, there‚Äôs nothing to worry about. Although we have a retain cycle between *apartment* & *person*, this is the root view controller of the application. The view controller will never be deallocated, so *apartment* & *person* will never be deallocated anyway. Nothing can go wrong.‚Äù

Well, not so fast.

## The problem

Let‚Äôs consider this scenario I‚Äôve met recently:

- Our app has a root ViewController & root ViewModel. The ViewModel has a retain cycle itself silently.
Note that since this is root ViewModel, we always can access this ViewModel: *AppDelegate -> window -> rootViewController -> viewModel*.
So this view model is not a leak.
- We went through almost every flow in the app, opened Memory Graph Debugger to check, and the Debugger showed there weren‚Äôt any leaks.

We thought the app was soooo fine and we were sooooo ready for the release üöÄ

But we were wrong.

We only went through **almost every flow**. We forgot 1 simple flow, which we think wasn‚Äôt important. It‚Äôs *‚ÄúLogout then Re-login‚Äù* flow.

The problem is that after the user performs the re-login flow, we create a new root ViewController & ViewModel. Because of that, **we lose the reference to the current root ViewModel**. And yes, it used to be fine, but now it has become Leak Memory and is ready to destroy our app ü§ß.

Even worse, the ViewModel keeps references to many different services, and since we‚Äôre using the publish/subscribe mechanism across the app, the leaked view model & leaked services kept emitting a lot of events. üí•

To summarize, I think we have these problems:

- **It‚Äôs tricky to find retain cycles that do not introduce a leak.** Memory Graph Debugger only helps to find leaks.
- **Retain cycle can easily introduce leaks if we do not pay enough attention.**
- Going through every flow in the app and checking for leaks manually is **boring, painful & easy to forget some special flow.**
- And to be honest, engineers do not often use Memory Graph Debugger to check for leaks in daily development.
Example: We have a bunch of leaks in our current project due to the custom navigator framework, but we don‚Äôt even know because we never use Memory Graph Debugger.

It makes me wonder: ‚ÄúCan I come up with a solution that can automate the leak-checking process?‚Äù

</p>

## Solution

My simple idea is:

1. Use a UI testing framework to simulate the flow in the application
2. Use the *leaks* tool provided by Apple to generate a memgraph. (more about this later)
3. Write a script to process the *generated memgraph* to check for leaks. If there any leaks are found, use *Danger* to mark the PR as failed or post a message to Slack.

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at each step

### Use a UI testing framework to simulate the application flow

Why do we need to use a UI Testing framework?

Imagine we‚Äôre checking for leaks manually. So what we will do is go through every flow in the app, then use the Memory Graph Debugger to check for leaks, right?

So, the UI Testing framework will help us to simulate the application flow automatically.

For the demo project, I decided to use Maestro to support me in simulating the application flow.

For the reason why I chose Maestro, or if you want to use another UI testing framework, please take a look at my project for more information. (The link to the project will be attached at the end of this article)

Here are the link to the demo video: https://vimeo.com/870326305

### Use the leaks tool to generate a memgraph

What is a memgraph file?

A memgraph file is essentially a snapshot of your process‚Äôs address space at an instance in time. Memgraphs record the address, size, stack trace, and references of each virtual region and each allocated malloc block.

*leaks* tool is a tool provided by Apple to generate a memgraph file from a running program and process the memgraph file.

You can learn more at this [WWDC 2018](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/416/) talk and [WWDC 2021](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10180/) talk.

So, after we ran the UI test, now we have a running program. It‚Äôs easy to generate a memgraph using the *leaks* tool:

```bash

leaks $PROGRAM_NAME --outputGraph=$MEMGRAPH_PATH

```

If you open the generated memgraph file, you will get the result same as when you use the Memory Graph Debugger.

With this memgraph file in our hand, we can easily check if the project has any leaks.

### Process the generated memgraph

For this step, I used Swift to write an executable program. The main idea of this program is to use the leaks tool to process the generated memgraph to find leaks

```bash

leaks $MEMGRAPH_PATH -q

```

The output of the script will be like this

<img src={image5.src} alt="Photo by Alexandre Debi√®ve on Unsplash" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />

The executable program will handle this output. If it finds any leaks, it will mark the PR as failed or notify engineering team.

### Integrate into your CI workflow

To integrate into your CI workflow, all you need to do is execute this script:

```bash
leaksdetector --process-name $PROCESS_NAME --executor-type maestro --maestro-flow-path ./maestro/leaksCheckFlow.yaml -d $DANGER_PATH
```

## Result
