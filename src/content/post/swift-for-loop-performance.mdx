Which function has better performance? *while*, *for loop*, or high-order function *reduce*?

I used this code to measure:

```swift

func processTime(_ title: String, closure: () -> ()) {
    let startTime = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()
    closure()
    let duration = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent() - startTime
    print(title, "Duration = \(String(format : "%.4f", duration))")
}

processTime("for-in") {
  var sum = 0
  for i in 0..<10000000 {
    sum += i
  }
}

processTime("while") {
  var sum = 0
  var i = 0
  while i<10000000 {
    sum += i
    i += 1
  }
}
        
processTime("reduce") {
  let sum = (0..<10000000).reduce(0, +)
}

```

I run the code above in Debug mode, and here is the result:

```swift

// Debug mode

for-in Duration = 1.5586
while Duration = 0.0115
reduce Duration = 1.5766

```

The result makes me curious. I wonder why *for-loop* and *reduce* are so much slower compared to whileðŸ¤”

Letâ€™s use our old friend *Profiler Instruments* to dig deeper.

<img src={image1.src} alt="image" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />

We can see what *for-loop* does under the hood:

- For-loop will be converted to **IndexingIterator**
- For each call to the next index, it will trigger next() function. (97% of the time is spent on callingnext() function.)
- Each time trigger next, it calls a bunch of protocol methods ([dynamic dispatch](https://trinhngocthuyen.com/posts/tech/method-dispatch-in-swift/)), which takes time to look at the witness table.

Cool, but why next() func uses dynamic dispatch? To find out, letâ€™s look at the implementation details of *IndexingIterator*.

```swift

public protocol Collection: Sequence {
    ...
}

public struct IndexingIterator<Elements: Collection> { 
    let _elements: Elements
}

extension IndexingIterator: IteratorProtocol, Sequence {
    public mutating func next() -> Elements.Element? {
        if _position == _elements.endIndex { return nil }
        let element = _elements[_position]
        _elements.formIndex(after: &_position)
        return element
    }
}

```

In the next() func, we use _elementsproperty. _elements could be any Collectionprotocol, so we don't know which member _elements[_position] or _elements.formIndex refers to at compile time.
Therefore, we must look at the vtable at runtime and use protocol witness.

After all, compare that to your while loop, which only needs to manage a single parameter and doesnâ€™t need to perform any table look-up.
It does less work, thatâ€™s why while loop has better performance than for-in and reduce .

## Explore the Swift compiler

Now, letâ€™s come to the fun (or headache) part. ðŸ¥¸

Instead of using Instruments, you can also use [godbolt](https://godbolt.org/) tool to understand how the code is compiled:

<img src={image2.src} alt="image" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />

Yeah, I know itâ€™s a bit hard to read all of these ðŸ¥²

But for now, just only focus on line 38 and line 44. These are function names that the compiler has mangled.
To trace back the originally readable text, we can use swift-demangle tool.

<img src={image3.src} alt="image" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />

Now we know that when Swift compiles for-in will be translated to:

```swift

let range: Range<Int> = 0..<10000000
let iterator = range.makeIterator()
while iterator.next() {
  ...
}

```

Feel yourself as a Swift compiler master already? ðŸ˜Ž

---

So weâ€™ve learned that while loop has better performance than for-in and reduce in Debug mode. How about Release mode, where we turn on some compiler optimization?

```swift

// Release mode

for-in Duration = 0.0063
while Duration = 0.0053
reduce Duration = 0.0075

```

To know the reason, we can use godbolt tool to compare the compiled version.

<img src={image4.src} alt="image" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />

With compiler optimization enabled, Swift doesn't need to perform a bunch of dynamic dispatch. All Swift needs to do is manage a counter variable, increase it by 1, perform the sum action, and repeat until it reaches the limit. ðŸš€

### Tips

If you donâ€™t know how to read SIL (same as me), you can ask your good friend ChatGPT for help ðŸ˜›

## What weâ€™ve learned?

- This is a friendly reminder that Profiler Instrument is a useful tool for debugging application performance.
- To measure your app performance, measure it in Release mode.
- Introduce you to the Swift compiler
