import SubscriptionCard from '/src/components/weekly/SubscriptionCard.astro';

I started building a SwiftUI project recently. The target I want to achieve is to build a project that can be used as a reference for building large production apps.

With that goal, I decided to apply Modular Architect and Clean Architect to the project.

While implementing the project, I faced some problems with the navigation. I also didnâ€™t find any online solutions that could meet all my scenarios. In this article, I will write about navigation problems I met in the project and how I solved them.

2. Open feature moduleâ€™s view from the Application module
3. Navigation inside feature module
4. Navigation between 2 views in different modules
5. Present a sheet
6. Passing data between views

Before going to the main part, letâ€™s take an overview look at the simple version of module dependencies in the project:

In this article, we will mainly focus on 4 modules: **Application**, **Movies**, **Search**, and **Router**.

## 1. Router module

Before iOS16, using NavigationView was not easy to customize (even if you want to popToRoot), thatâ€™s why we have a lot of different open sources for SwiftUI navigation.

With the release of NavigationStack, itâ€™s easier to handle navigation logic, so I decided to use NavigationStack in the project.

To get started, created a Router class to wrap navigation logic and provide simpler APIs to interact with:

```swift

public final class Router: ObservableObject {
    @Published public var navPath = NavigationPath()
    public init() {}

    public func navigate(to destination: any Hashable) {
        navPath.append(destination)
    }

    public func navigateBack() {
        navPath.removeLast()
    }

    public func navigateToRoot() {
        navPath.removeLast(navPath.count)
    }
}

```

Since all feature modules need to use the *Router*, so I created a separate package for it. (You can see in the diagram that Iâ€™ve created a Router module and other modules depend on it.)

Using *Router* is dead simple:

```swift

// Application Module
import Router

struct AppCoordinator: View {
    @ObservedObject var router = Router()
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack(path: $router.navPath) {
            ...
        }
        .environmentObject(router)
    }
}

```

## 2. Open Featureâ€™s view from the Application module

Let's say we want to open *MovieView* in the **Movies** module from the **Application** module. A simple approach is:

```swift

// Application Module
import Movies

var body: some View {
    MovieView(
        viewModel: MovieViewModel(
           useCase: MovieUseCase(repository: MovieRepository())
        )
    )
}

```

That will work. However, the drawback is that I will need to mark *MovieViewModel*, *MovieUseCase*, and *MovieRepository* as public so that they can be accessed outside the Movies module.

When developing a framework, I always try to hide the frameworkâ€™s implementation details as much as possible. So the above approach canâ€™t make me happy.

To solve that problem, I decided to go with the MVVM-C approach by creating Coordinators.

```swift

// Application Module 
import Movie
struct AppCoordinator: View {
    var body: some View {
        MovieCoordinator()
    }
}

// Movie module
/// MovieCoordinator is the only public component we need.
public struct MovieCoordinator {
    public init() {}
    var body: some View {
        MovieView(
            viewModel: MovieViewModel(
               useCase: MovieUseCase(repository: MovieRepository())
            )
        )
    }
}

```

Another benefit of the Coordinator approach is that I can *easily inject dependencies* to the **Movies** module from the **Application** module:

```swift

// Movies module

public struct MovieCoordinator: some View {
    private let dependencies: Dependencies
    public init(dependencies: Dependencies) {
        self.dependencies = dependencies
    }

    var body: some View {
        MovieView(
            repository: MovieRepository(apiClient: dependencies.apiClient)
        )
    }   

    // Dependencies of `MovieModule` that need to be injected from App module.
    struct Dependencies {
        let apiClient: ApiClient
    }
}

```

## 3. Handle navigation inside a module

Enum-based should be the best approach when using **NavigationStack**. I defined an enum containing all destinations inside the module, and handle the navigation logic in the Coordinator.

Example of **Movies** module:

```swift

enum PrivateDestination: Hashable {
    case genreDetail
    case movieDetail(movie: Movie)
} 

public struct MovieCoordinator: some View {
     ...
     var body: some View {
        MovieView(...)
        .navigationDestination(for: Destination.self) { destination in
            switch destination {
            case .genreDetail:
                Text("Genre detail")
            case let .movieDetail(movie):
                MovieDetailView(viewModel: .init(movie: movie, movieRepository: MovieDetailRepository(apiClientService: dependencies.apiClient)))
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Note that the reason I named the enum ***PrivateDestination*** is that the enum can only be used for navigation between screens **in the same module**.

## 4. Navigation between 2 different modules

With Modular Architect, how can we navigate between 2 screens in different modules?
For example, how to open SearchView (in the Search module) from MovieView (in the Movie module)?

The rule of thumb of Modular Architecture is **that modules at the same level canâ€™t depend on each other**. That means the **Movies** module canâ€™t open the **Search** module directly. Since the **Application** module knows about feature modules, I handled the navigation logic here:

```swift

// Movie module
// First, create the enum `PublicDestination` containing destinations outside the current module.
public enum MoviePublicDestination: Hashable {
    case search
}

```

Then we can handle the navigation logic between 2 feature modules in the **Application** module:

```swift

// Application module
import Movie
import Search
import Router

struct AppCoordinator: View {
    @ObservedObject var router = Router()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack(path: $router.navPath) {
            MovieCoordinator(...)
                .navigationDestination(for: MoviePublicDestination.self) { destination in
                    switch destination {
                    case .search:
                        SearchCoordinator(...)
                    }
                }
        }
        .environmentObject(router)
    }
}


```

5. Present a sheet

To present a sheet, I still used *.sheet(item:content:)* API. I expected that it should be easy and similar to how I handle navigation:

```swift

public final class Router: ObservableObject {
    @Published public var presentedSheet: any Identifiable?

    public func presentSheet(destination: any Identifiable) {
        presentedSheet = AnyIdentifiable(destination: destination)
    }
    ...
}

```

But I faced this issue with that approach:

To overcome this problem, I need to unbox [existential types](https://swiftrocks.com/whats-any-understanding-type-erasure-in-swift) first. And my solution was to create **AnyIdentifiable**:

```swift

// Router module
public class AnyIdentifiable: Identifiable {
    public let destination: any Identifiable
    public init(destination: any Identifiable) {
        self.destination = destination
    }
}

public final class Router: ObservableObject {
    ...
    @Published public var presentedSheet: AnyIdentifiable?
    public func presentSheet(destination: any Identifiable) {
        presentedSheet = AnyIdentifiable(destination: destination)
    }
}

```

Now I could handle the sheet easily:

```swift

struct MovieCoordinator: View {
    @EnvironmentObject private var router: Router
    var body: some View {
        ...
        .sheet(item: $router.presentedSheet) { sheetDestination in
            if let destination = sheetDestination.destination as? MovieSheetDesination {
                switch destination {
                    case .bottomSheetError:
                        BottomSheetError()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

## 6. Passing data between views

How can we pass data from view2 back to view1? I thought it should be easy, just need to use closure or Binding as associated type:

```swift

enum Destination: Hashable {
    case view2(callback: (String) -> Void)
    case view3(callback: Binding<String>)
}

```

And once again, not so fast ðŸ˜£

With **NavigationStack**, the destination enum needs to conform Hashable protocol. Closure and Binding donâ€™t conform to Hashable, so I need to made the enum conform to Hashable manually:

```swift

enum Destination: Hashable {
    case view2(callback: (String) -> Void)
    case view3(callback: Binding<String>)

    static func == (lhs: Destination, rhs: Destination) -> Bool {
        if case .view2 = lhs, case .view2 = rhs { return true }
        if case .view3 = lhs, case .view3 = rhs { return true }
        return false
    }

    func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher) {
        switch self {
        case .view2:
            hasher.combine(1)
        case .view3:
            hasher.combine(2)
        }
    }
}

```

And that was good to go ðŸš€
