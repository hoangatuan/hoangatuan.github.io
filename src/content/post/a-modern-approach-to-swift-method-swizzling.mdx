Method swizzling is a cool feature that allows us to change the implementation of an existing selector at runtime.

If you never heard of it, please check out [my previous article](https://magz.techover.io/2021/07/25/method-swizzling-in-swift/). In that article, I’ve explained pretty detail what method swizzling is, how we can use method swizzling, and what we should consider before using it.

Recently while I was developing my project which needed to use Method swizzling, I realized that from Swift 5.1 we have a better native API to achieve method swizzling.

Let’s find out!

## What is method swizzling?

For those who don’t want to read my previous article, here is a brief explanation of method swizzling.

> Method swizzling is the process of changing the implementation of an existing selector at runtime.

## Real-world example

One of the real-world examples that apply Method swizzling is the famous [Pulse](https://github.com/kean/Pulse) framework.

The magic behind Pulse is that Pulse will use a custom URLSession delegate to capture network requests and perform logging.

Here is how Pulse injects its custom URLSession delegate to your URLSession:

```swift

private extension URLSession {
    // This is the custom init method to replace the original URLSession.init
    @objc class func pulse_init(configuration: URLSessionConfiguration, delegate: URLSessionDelegate?, delegateQueue: OperationQueue?) -> URLSession {
        ...
        // Create custom delegate and inject to the URLSession, so that later Pulse can perform custom logic in this delegate to capture network logs.
        let delegate = URLSessionProxyDelegate(delegate: delegate)
        return self.pulse_init(configuration: configuration, delegate: delegate, delegateQueue: delegateQueue)
    }
}

public extension URLSessionProxyDelegate {
    // When the app start & berfore init URLsession, call this function to perform method swizzling 
    static func enableAutomaticRegistration() {
        ...
        if let lhs = class_getClassMethod(URLSession.self, #selector(URLSession.init(configuration:delegate:delegateQueue:))),
           let rhs = class_getClassMethod(URLSession.self, #selector(URLSession.pulse_init(configuration:delegate:delegateQueue:))) {
            method_exchangeImplementations(lhs, rhs)
        }
    }
}

```

## New native API to achieve method swizzling

As of Swift 5.1, Swift provides the *@_dynamicReplacement* modifier to handle method swizzling.

Using the new syntax is simple, just need to follow these steps:

Mark the original function that needs to be replaced with the *dynamic* modifier.
Use the *@_dynamicReplacement* modifier upon a replacement function. This modifier takes the original function’s name as a parameter.
The replacement function type must be the same as the original function type.

```swift

class SampleClass {
    // 1. Mark the original function with the dynamic modifier
    dynamic func original() {
        print("I am the original")
    }
}

extension SampleClass {
   // 2. Use @_dynamicReplacement modifier, and the parameter for this modifier is the name of original function.
   @_dynamicReplacement(for: original)
   func replacement() {
        // original() // You can still call the original function here.
        print("I'm just a replacement")
    }
}

```

Sample code:

```swift

let sample = SampleClass()
sample.original()

// Output
// "I'm just a replacement"

```

The cool thing is we don’t need to call any function to perform swizzle. With this modifier, the swizzle **will happen when the program starts**.

Above is a simple example of how to use *@_dynamicReplacement* modifier. Let’s try some more complicated example

```swift

class SampleClass {
    dynamic func original() {
        print("I am the original")
    }
    
    dynamic func original_withParameters(for param1: String, param2: String) {
        print("I am the original - param1: \(param1) - param2: \(param2)")
    }
    
    dynamic func original_withParameters_andReturnType(param: String) -> Int {
        print("I am the original - param: \(param) - returnType: Int")
        return 1
    }
}

extension SampleClass {
    @_dynamicReplacement(for: original)
    func replacement() {
        print("I'm just a replacement")
    }
    
    @_dynamicReplacement(for: original_withParameters(for:param2:))
    func replacement_withParameters(param1: String, param2: String) {
        print("I am the replacement - param1: \(param1) - param2: \(param2)")
    }
    
    @_dynamicReplacement(for: original_withParameters_andReturnType(param:))
    func replacement_withParameters_andReturnType(param: String) -> Int {
        print("I am the replacement - param: \(param) - returnType: Int")
        return 2
    }
}

// Sample code
let sample = SampleClass()
sample.original()
sample.original_withParameters(for: "Param1", param2: "Param2")

// Output
print("I'm just a replacement")
print("I am the replacement - param1: \(param1) - param2: \(param2)")

```

## Conclusion

This new modifier is much nicer compared to the way we need to use objective-c code to swizzle.

Few things to keep in mind:

- The *@_dynamicReplacement* modifier has the underscore syntax, which means it’s not official release. More information [here](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/ReferenceGuides/UnderscoredAttributes.md).
- *@_dynamicReplacement* modifier will automatically perform swizzle when the program starts. If you want to perform the swizzle at an arbitrary point in time, you will need to use the old way.
