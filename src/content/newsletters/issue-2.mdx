## What I'm reading

### [Building Mobile app at scale](https://www.mobileatscale.com/)

This is a cool book that mention about challenges when building mobile app at scale. 
It's a good book, but I think the author doesn't go deep enough into the technical details. Because of that, I decided to investigate more time to dig deeper, and I will publish a book review at the end of the month. Stay tuned!

## Great articles this week

### 1. [Testing strategy in big tech companies](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/discussions/discussions/6)

This is an old and famous thread about testing strategy in big tech companies. It's a great thread to read if you are interested in testing strategy. It's a long thread, but it's worth reading.
There are more to say about testing, but I will dig deeper into it in the other article.

### 2. [Effortless iOS Snapshot Testing Using Emerge Tools](https://joinhandshake.com/blog/our-team/effortless-ios-snapshot-testing-using-emerge-tools/)

This week, while I was reading about Snapshot testing, I found this article about how to use [Emerge Tools](https://github.com/EmergeTools/SnapshotPreviews) to make snapshot testing easier. I think it's a great tool to help you write snapshot tests faster and more efficiently.

Some other tools like [FBSnapshotTestCase](https://github.com/uber/ios-snapshot-test-case), Pointfree's [SnapshotTesting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing), ... works by creating reference image and store it locally, writing snapshot tests, and comparing the reference image with the new image. 
That techniques faces some problems like:

- The reference image is stored locally, so it's make the repository larger.
- We need to write and maintain snapshot tests.

Emerge Tools leverage SwiftUI's Preview to solve these issues:

- It find all Previews in the project and generate snapshot tests for them.
- The reference image is stored in the cloud, so it's not make the repository larger.

### 3. [Being a good citizen in the land of SwiftSyntax](https://www.pointfree.co/blog/posts/116-being-a-good-citizen-in-the-land-of-swiftsyntax)

Using SwiftSyntax has several challenges: 

- Versioning Complexity
- Breaking Changes
- Dependency Resolution

The article has mention detail about these challenges and how to solve them. It's a great article to read if you are using SwiftSyntax in your project.

To solve that problem, there is a open source Github Action tool to check for the compatibility of your SwiftSyntax version with the latest SwiftSyntax version. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Matejkob/swift-macro-compatibility-check)
