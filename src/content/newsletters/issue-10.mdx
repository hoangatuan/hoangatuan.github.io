## Great articles this week

### 1. [Swift Build Times and Module Verification](https://pfandrade.me/blog/swift-build-times-and-module-verification/?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2058&utm_content=2024-12-29)

Build with Timing Sumary is a great feature of Xcode to analyze the build time of a project. By using this feature, we can identify the bottlenecks in the build process and optimize it.   
In this article, the author uses that feature to analyze, and adjust the build setting to cut off the unnecessary works, and reduce the build time significantly.

### 2. [Design Uber Eats - iOS System Design Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbXDhAKgWek&list=PLf9ED5UyqSFYlYYmojc5w1qAI_fYJVWPQ)

Mobile system design is a crucial skill for a software engineer, and it is one of the interview rounds in big tech companies.   
I had never learned about this topic before, so I decided to learn about it.   
I found this great video on YouTube while I was researching the mobile system design interview. The video explains step-by-step solutions to approach the system design interview questions.    
The author has a series of videos about system design interviews, and I highly recommend you check it out.

### 3. [Embracing passwordless authentication with Grabâ€™s Passkey](https://engineering.grab.com/embracing-passwordless-authentication-with-passkey)

Passkeys is a new authentication method in recent years. It is a passwordless authentication method that uses a combination of biometric and device information to authenticate users.    
This article from Grab explains an overview of Passkeys, and how they integrate Passkeys into their system.    
If you want to integrate Passkeys into your iOS app, I recommend [this WWDC video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10092/) from Apple.

### 4. [Rules of Thumb for Software Development Estimations](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/project-estimates/)

Software development estimation is hard. To make it more accurate, we need to build a system to track the estimation and the actual time. Not only that, we need to learn from the past and improve our estimation skill over time.   
Here is a great article that takes a deep dive into software estimation, and how we should approach it in a better way.
