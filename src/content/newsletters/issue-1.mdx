Starting a weekly newsletter is a great way what I've been up to and what I've been reading. It also force me to read more, and commit more in contributing to the community. I hope you enjoy it.
This week, I've been busy with personal work, so I didn't have much time to read. But I did find some interesting articles that I think you might enjoy.

## What I'm building

### [iOS Performance Optimization](https://github.com/hoangatuan/iOS-Performance-Optimization)

Performance is a critical aspect of mobile development. There are many things you need to care about to make your app run smoothly: Appsize, App hang, App launch time, ...
I have created a repository to compile foundational knowledge on iOS performance, including tools for optimization and real-life examples of how major companies implement these techniques.
I hope you find this resource helpful and consider contributing to the repository 💪
