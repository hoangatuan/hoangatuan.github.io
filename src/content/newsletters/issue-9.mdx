import SubscriptionCard from '/src/components/weekly/SubscriptionCard.astro';

I skipped the newsletter last week because I was on Christmas holiday ðŸŽ„. But I'm back this week with the last newsletter of 2024.    
2024 is not quite a great year for me, but at least I've learned something. In 2025, I promise that I try my best to make it the best year ever!!!
I hope you have a great holiday and are ready for the new year.
