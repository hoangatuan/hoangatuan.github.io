Hey there, I'm Eric â€“ Welcome to my space of the internet! ðŸ¥³
I'm a Senior Software Engineer at OKX in Singapore.
I'm all about sharing knowledge because I believe that's how we learn and level up together. Here, you'll find me dropping gems on software development, with a special focus on iOS.
I'm also a big fan of booksâ€”they're the secret sauce to leveling up your skills. So, I'll be sharing my take on some awesome reads and giving you the lowdown on what I've learned.
I hope you vibe with the content and find it useful. Got questions or thoughts? Hit me up in the comments or shoot me a message anytime!
